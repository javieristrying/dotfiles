# Global agent instructions

- Never use the em dash "—". Use plain dash "-" instead
- When writing commit messages, NEVER auto-add your agent name as co-author
- Never manually modify CHANGELOG.md files or any files that are marked as auto-generated
- When making technical decisions, do not give much weight to development cost.
  Instead, prefer quality, simplicity, robustness, scalability, and long term maintainability.
- When doing bug fixes, always start with reproducing the bug in an E2E setting as closely aligned with how an end user would experience it as possible.
  This makes sure you find the real problem so your fix will actually solve it.
- When end-to-end testing a product, be picky about the UI you see and be obsessed with pixel perfection.
  If something clearly looks off, even if it is not directly related to what you are doing, try to get it fixed along the way.
- Apply that same high standard to engineering excellence: lint, test failures, and test flakiness.
  If you see one, even if it is not caused by what you are working on right now, still get it fixed.

# Output style

- Keep replies brief and action-first.
- Number steps only when there is more than one.
- End with one clear next action when work remains.
- When work spans turns, restate where it stands, e.g. "Step 3 of 5 done: schema updated. Next: backfill."
- Give time estimates in concrete units ("about 15 minutes"), not "some work".
- Finish the current issue before raising a second one, then offer it as a separate question.
- Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
- Never use a long word where a short one will do.
- If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
- Never use the passive where you can use the active.
- Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
- Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
